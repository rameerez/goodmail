# ðŸ’Œ Goodmail - Make your Rails SaaS transactional emails look beautiful
[![Gem Version](https://badge.fury.io/rb/goodmail.svg)](https://badge.fury.io/rb/goodmail)

Send beautiful, simple transactional emails with zero HTML hell.

Goodmail turns your ugly, default, text-only emails into SaaS-ready emails. It's an opinionated, minimal, expressive Ruby DSL for sending beautiful, production-grade transactional emails in Rails apps â€” no templates, no partials, no HTML hell. The template works well and looks nice across email clients.

Here's the catch: there's only one template. You can't change it. You're guaranteed you'll send good emails, but the cost is you don't have much flexibility. If you're okay with this, welcome to `goodmail`! You'll be shipping decent emails that look great everywhere in no time.

(And you can still use Action Mailer for all other template-intensive emails â€“ Goodmail doesn't replace Action Mailer, just builds on top of it!)

## Installation

Add this line to your application's Gemfile:

```ruby
gem "goodmail"
```

And then execute:

```bash
bundle install
```

## Configuration

You can (and should!) edit the default strings in the Goodmail initializer.

Create an initializer file at `config/initializers/goodmail.rb`:

```ruby
# config/initializers/goodmail.rb

Goodmail.configure do |config|
  # The main accent color used for buttons and links in the email body.
  # Default: "#348eda"
  config.brand_color = "#E62F17" # Your brand's primary color

  # The company name displayed in the email footer and used by the default `sign` helper.
  # Default: "Example Inc."
  config.company_name = "MyApp Inc."

  # Optional: URL to your company logo. If set, it will appear centered in the header.
  # Recommended size: max-height 30px.
  # Default: nil
  config.logo_url = "https://cdn.myapp.com/images/email_logo.png"

  # Optional: Custom text displayed in the footer below the copyright.
  # Use this to explain why the user received the email.
  # Default: nil
  config.footer_text = "You are receiving this email because you signed up for an account at MyApp."

  # Optional: Global default URL for unsubscribe links (both the List-Unsubscribe
  # header and the optional visible link in the footer).
  # Goodmail *does not* handle the unsubscribe logic; you must provide a valid URL.
  # Can be overridden per email via headers[:unsubscribe_url].
  # Default: nil
  config.unsubscribe_url = "https://myapp.com/emails/unsubscribe"

  # Optional: Whether to show a visible unsubscribe link in the footer.
  # Requires an unsubscribe URL to be set (globally or per-email).
  # Default: false
  config.show_footer_unsubscribe_link = true

  # Optional: The text for the visible footer unsubscribe link.
  # Default: "Unsubscribe"
  config.footer_unsubscribe_link_text = "Click here to unsubscribe"
end
```

Make sure to restart your Rails server after creating or modifying the initializer.

## Quick start

Use the `Goodmail.compose` method to compose emails using the DSL, then call `.deliver_now` or `.deliver_later` on it (your usual standard Action Mailer methods)


```ruby
# In a controller action, background job, or service object
Goodmail.compose(to: user.email, subject: "Welcome!") do
  text "Hey #{user.first_name},"
  text     "Thanks for joining. Confirm below:"
  button   "Confirm account", confirm_url
end.deliver_now
```

You can also call `.deliver_later`:

```ruby
mail = Goodmail.compose(
  to: @user.email,
  from: ..., # etc.
  subject: "Your password has been reset"
) do
  # ... DSL content ...
end

mail.deliver_later
```

*(Requires Active Job configured.)*

## Why does `goodmail` exist?

Here's the problem: you can't just use standard HTML and CSS in mails.

Emails are notoriously complicated to work with, because they're very difficult to style.

Modern CSS doesn't work in mails, because email clients render styles differently and some only support a primitive subset of HTML / CSS.

So, for example, you can't use stylesheets **at all**: all CSS needs to be inlined. You can't use many modern CSS properties either.

This is why many emails still use `<table>` elements, for example. It's the only way of making mails look good!

In fact, Mailgun released years ago [a few battle-tested HTML templates for emails](https://github.com/mailgun/transactional-email-templates). I took one of those email templates and have been using it in my projects for years.

So, can't this just be an Action Mailer `.erb` template instead?

I thought the same! And that's actually how I started using it. But after using it for years I realized I ended up building my own "proto-DSL" around it: I decomposed the email HTML template in partials, I was copying the same partials from project to project, etc. And setting up good emails in every new project took me a while because each project would have slight inconsistencies in the mail partials.

So making it into a gem with a simple DSL was my solution to solve this email HTML mess.


## Usage

### Available DSL Methods

Inside the `Goodmail.compose` block, you have access to these methods:

*   `h1(text)`, `h2(text)`, `h3(text)`: Styled heading tags.
*   `text(string)`: A paragraph of text. Handles `\n` for line breaks. Allows simple inline `<a>` tags with `href` attributes; other HTML is stripped for safety.
*   `button(link_text, url)`: A prominent, styled call-to-action button.
*   `image(src, alt = "", width: nil, height: nil)`: Embeds an image, centered by default.
*   `space(pixels = 16)`: Adds vertical whitespace.
*   `line`: Adds a horizontal rule (`<hr>`).
*   `center { ... }`: Centers the content generated within the block.
*   `sign(name = Goodmail.config.company_name)`: Adds a standard closing signature line.
*   `html(raw_html_string)`: **Use with extreme caution.** Allows embedding raw, *un-sanitized* HTML. Only use this if you absolutely trust the source of the string.

### Adding Unsubscribe Functionality

Goodmail helps you add the `List-Unsubscribe` header and an optional visible link, but **you must provide the actual URL** where users can unsubscribe. Goodmail does not generate unsubscribe URLs or handle the logic.

1.  **Provide the URL:** You have two options:
    *   **Globally:** Set `config.unsubscribe_url = "your_global_url"` in the initializer (`config/initializers/goodmail.rb`).
    *   **Per-Email:** Pass `unsubscribe_url: "your_specific_url"` in the headers hash when calling `Goodmail.compose`. This overrides the global setting for that email.

    ```ruby
    # Example using per-email override
    mail = Goodmail.compose(
      to: recipient.email,
      # ... other headers ...
      unsubscribe_url: manage_subscription_url(recipient) # Your app's URL helper
    ) do
      # ... email content ...
    end
    ```
    *If an `unsubscribe_url` is provided (either globally or per-email), Goodmail will automatically add the standard `List-Unsubscribe` header.*

2.  **Optionally Show Footer Link:**
    *   To show a visible link in the email footer, set `config.show_footer_unsubscribe_link = true` in the initializer.
    *   You can customize the link text with `config.footer_unsubscribe_link_text` (default: "Unsubscribe").
    *   *Note: The footer link only appears if an `unsubscribe_url` was provided (step 1) AND `config.show_footer_unsubscribe_link` is true.* 

    ```ruby
    # config/initializers/goodmail.rb
    Goodmail.configure do |config|
      # ... other settings
      config.unsubscribe_url = "https://myapp.com/preferences"
      config.show_footer_unsubscribe_link = true
      config.footer_unsubscribe_link_text = "Manage email preferences"
    end
    ```

## Development
